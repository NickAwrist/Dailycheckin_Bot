### Step 6:
Refresh your page and a ton of entries should populate the page. There should be an entry called **getUserUnreadContent**. Click on that. 

### Step 7: 
On the right side there should be titles *Summary* and *Request*. Under **Request** you will see your Hoyolab cookie. Copy it and paste it where it is needed to be pasted.
